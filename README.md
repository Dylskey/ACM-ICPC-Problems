# ACM-ICPC-Problems
Programming problems from ACM-ICPC site.

This repository will hold all the ACM-ICPC problems I solve in my free time. 

I find it invigorating to solve these problems because they are programming puzzles. 
There is no need for graceful failure or accounting for bad input. These problems are
simply about solving a particular problem with programming.

All solutions are in Java.
